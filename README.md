# Image-Colour-Transfer Processing Executable.
=============================================================
##### User Friendly Software for Photographers. 

This repository provides photographic processing software that is intended to be used by photographers who have only moderate computing experience.

The processing provides for the re-colouring of one image using the colours of another image.  The image to be re-coloured is known as the ‘target image’ and the image that provides the colours is known as the ‘palette image’.  This processing is illustrated by the following examples.

*The images below show target images and palette images followed by the corresponding resultant images.*
