# Image-Colour-Transfer Processing Executable.
============================================================
##### User Friendly Software for Photographers. 

This repository provides photographic processing software that is intended to be used by photographers who have only moderate computing experience.
The processing provides for the re-colouring of one image with the colours of another image.  The image to be re-coloured is known as the ‘target image’ and the image that provides the colours is known as the ‘palette image’.  This processing is illustrated by the following examples.

*The images below show target images and palette images followed by the corresponding resultant images.*

The executable in this repository implements the processing represented by the source code and documentation under the heading ‘Further Enhanced Image-Colour-Transfer’ in the following repository https://github.com/TJCoding/Enhanced-Image-Colour-Transfer#further-enhanced-image-colour-transfer. It has been presented here separately from the source code and technical support details to make it accessible to less experienced users.
